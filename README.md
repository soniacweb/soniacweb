## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Developer in London âœ¨ 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently revamping my portfolio site in React and Express.
- ðŸŒ± Lockdown has me learning JavaScript and the MERN stack:)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ecommerce projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m mentoring over at CFG and CYF on a lot of their software engineering fundamentals. I mentor for a lot of different reasons: I want to use my spare time productively, I enjoy meeting people from all walks of life on a similar learning journey to me, I like supporting people's development and I think it adds another layer for my own learning and development. There is always something new to learn! :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... gardening- it's my new lockdown hobby.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... by email or on linkedin! 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm bilingual and enjoy soaking up languages. At the moment, I'm learning conversational French and basic hanguk-eo.
